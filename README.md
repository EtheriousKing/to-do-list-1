The first page, called the 'Work', is implemented using EJS, Node.js, Express, and jQuery. In this page, you can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The second page, named the 'Daily' page, is implemented using EJS, Express, and jQuery. It is entirely front-end based. This project was undertaken as a learning experience and does not include any major styling components.
